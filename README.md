# Unit Testing with Jasmine

This project used a web-based application that reads RSS feeds, which included Jasmine and a complete set of tests. 

## How Works

I was tasked with writing the remaining specifications and tests in Jasmine to complete the suite.
I used Jasmine to write a number of tests for the application. These check the underlying logic as well as the event handling and DOM manipulation.

The results of all tests are displayed in a Jasmine container at the bottom of the browser. These list the tests performed and indicate which ones met the stated specifications. When a test fails, Jasmine produces an error message and trace for the failure.

## Getting Started

Download the GitHub source code. Open the .css, fonts, jasmine and js and html files with a text editor. To open the index.html file with any browser.

### Prerequisites

* CSS -  Cascading Style Sheets
* HTML - HyperText Markup Language 
* JavaScript - JavaScript is a programming language for the web.
* Jasmine -  Is an open source testing framework for JavaScript.

### Development

All tests are located in jasmine/spec/feedreader.js.
